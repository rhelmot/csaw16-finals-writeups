# CSAW Finals 2016 Writeups/Solutions

I played in the CSAW 2016 Finals at NYU in November.
I spent my entire CTF on two series of challenges, Cybertronix 64k and Super Monster Ball.
I got first blood on all four of these flags, and was the only person in the CTF to solve either of the Super Monster Ball challenges :)

Writeups and solutions I wrote during the CTF (cleaned up slightly!) are available in the appropriate subdirectories.
